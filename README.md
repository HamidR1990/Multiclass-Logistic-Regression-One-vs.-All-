# Multiclass Logistic Regression


##### This is python code for the multiclass regression algorithm via "one vs. all" method. In this little project, through logistic regression algorithm we predict the label of an input sample. This label could have several value. 




#### The main object of this project is to write a nonlinear regression algorithm without using usual libraries, in particular, scikit-learn and other prepared tools.



### Dataset:

"iris" which is a traditional dataset in machine learning for classification tasks.
